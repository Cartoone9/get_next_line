# get_next_line

This repository contains my get_next_line project, an assignment from the first circle of 42 School. The main goal was to build a function that could read text, line by line, from a given file. This project really helped solidify my understanding of how to handle files, the ins and outs of static variables, and smart ways to manage buffers in C using the stack.

## Usage

This project is only asking for a function and not a working program, so you cannot compile it unless you add a main.

## Note on Project State

All projects from my 42 cursus are preserved in their state immediately following their final evaluation. While they may contain mistakes or stylistic errors, I've chosen not to alter them. This approach provides a clear and authentic timeline of my progress and learning journey as a programmer.
